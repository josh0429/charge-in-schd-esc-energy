# The critical escape energy of a charged particle orbiting a weakly magnetized Schwarzschild black hole

Uploaded here are data points of the critical escape energy in Figures 2 and 3 of [*Chaotic exits from a weakly magnetized Schwarzschild black hole*](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/ac0e19). The data set contains a collection of (*ρ*<sub>0</sub>, *ε*<sub>esc</sub>) points for different values of the parameter *b*. The data set is encoded as a `.mx` file which can be imported in *Wofram Mathematica*.
